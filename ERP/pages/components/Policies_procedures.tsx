          LEAVE POLICY
        </Typography>
        <p>
          The objective of this policy is to regulate all forms of leave that
          are accrued, and to outline procedures to be followed for the granting
          and taking of such leave. Policy provisions apply to all employees.
          Explore And Do Technologies Pvt. Ltd. works only 5 days a week, and so
          no employee is entitled for casual leaves during their tenure as a
          permanent employee. Leaves will be approved only for medical
          emergencies of the employee or with the immediate family. The employee
          will have to provide doctor's report supporting the absence if asked
          by the management. Any leave which is not an emergency or sick leave
          (weddings, half days, outings, etc) needs to be approved by the HR or
          the management, which will be considered as a LOP (loss of pay) for
          the particular day. Leaves or absence from work without prior approval
          will not be encouraged and strict action will be taken by the
          management for such behavior. For employee on probation period no
          leaves are given, any leave during the time of your probation will be
          a LOP. We will be following a point based system to ensure discipline
          in the company. (Refer attendance policy) Procedure of Leave
          Application
        </p>
        <p>
          Any employee who is willing to take leave as LOP should a week (7
          days) before inform the HR or the management and get approval. For
          medical emergencies or in case of sick leave we expect the employee to
          send an official mail to the HR and the management seeking leave for
          the required day. Permissions (written/oral) through any team leader
          or teammate will not be accepted. Approval for any permission/ leave
          is mandate from HR/ management.

          Formal Warnings
        </Typography>
        <p>
          Disciplinary action involving, for example, dismissal or suspension
          may in certain serious situations not be preceded by formal or
          informal warning. Normally, however, it is anticipated that the first
          stage of the formal procedure will be a formal warning, issued in the
          course of a formal interview by the HR/ managers. The employee will
          have the right to state his or her case and to be accompanied at their
          request by a representative or colleague of their choice from within
          the company. The formal warning, if given, will be confirmed in
          writing to the employee, will specify the reasons for which it is
          given, and will specify the period of time allowed for the necessary
          improvement to be made. The period allowed for improvement should in
          no case be less than one month or more than three months. If a first
          formal warning is not effective in producing the necessary improvement
          in work orbehavior, the manager or their nominee should issue a second
          and final warning. The procedure will be as for the first formal
          warning, but the warning itself and the written confirmation should
          make it clear as to what further disciplinary action will be taken if
          the necessary improvement is not achieved within the specified period.

          Performance appraisal underpins good performance management practice
          and staff development atExplore And Do Technologies Pvt. Ltd..
          Appraisal is a key mechanism for explicitly directing all employees’
          contribution so that individuals can see how their work supports the
          aims and objectives of their, department and as a whole. TheExplore
          And Do Technologies Pvt. Ltd. process should provide clear direction
          towards personal and organizational objectives so that each individual
          is able to achieve their potential and contribute to the company's
          success. Appraisal plays an essential role in identifying training,
          development and career needs and ensuring that individual contribution
          is valued and recognized.
        </p>
        <p>The objectives of the appraisal process are to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Maximize performance</li>
          <li>Reinforce the trust’s values and behaviors</li>
          <li>Acknowledge good performance</li>
          <li>Set objectives for the year ahead</li>
          <li>Encourage staff development</li>
          <li>
            Objectives for each employee will be set before or as soon as
            practicable after, the start of each appraisal period. The
            objectives set will be rigorous, challenging, achievable,
            time-bound, fair and equitable in relation to employees with similar
            roles/responsibilities and experience. Performance appraisal
            discussions will be held over a designated 4 times annually. They
            will be arranged by the appraisee’s superior.There are different
            methods of assessing performance (Performance Appraisal) Review by
            Manager, Peer Review, 360-degree review, etc., The discussion will
            be held in private. Information shared during the appraisal will be
            shared only with senior management. Confidentiality of appraisal
            will be respected. The appraiser (usually the employee’s HR /

          ATTENDANCE POLICY
        </Typography>
        <p>
          The objective of attendance policy in office is to make employees
          present for work, on time, each day. Regular attendance and
          punctuality are important to keep the team and company running
          smoothly. Arriving late, being tardy or absence from work causes
          disruptions and creates burden on colleagues. The total work time of
          all the employees is 9 hours unless specified otherwise, by the
          management. The distribution of time should be such that at the end of
          each day it can be summed up to 8 hours on desk. The 1 hour break can
          be split in 2 times (2 of 15 minutes and 1 of 30 minutes) or 1 hour
          break of 30 minutes each, not in any case a break should last for more
          than 30 minutes. Breaks exceeding 1 hour will result in deduction from
          your Overtime hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case of network breakdown, we expect co-operation from the
          employees.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the breakdown is up to 1 hour the employee is expected to do
          offline work for 30 minutes and take the upcoming break of 30 minutes
          during this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will be maintaining a point based system for easy understanding and
          calculation of attendance and leaves:
        </p>
        <ul>

            logging in 8-15 minutes after the scheduled time for any reason not

          </li>
          <li>
            Each time an employee accumulates enough point, the employee will
            receive notice or warning. The point system will be calculated for
            every month. If an employee is logging in late or logging off early
            prior approval is necessary from HR or the Management, failing to
            which the action taken by the management cannot be questioned.
